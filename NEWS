What's done:

* Appending
* Getting the length
* Accessing an item
* Repetition
* Basic rebalancing(small nodes are not amalgamated)

TODO:
* Better rebalancing
* Slices
* Search/replace
* Hashing
* Comparisons

THINGS TO LOOK INTO:
* Should literals be allocated on demand or is it ok to keep all literals as LITERAL_LENGTH?
* Keeping the depth less than 32 (as in the PyPy implementation)
